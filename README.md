# TranzmeoMachineTest

library used

* pandas -> python data manipulation library to processing and cleaning data.
* numpy - > matrix manipulation and array slicing
* radians, cos, sin, asin, sqrt ->  build in python math library used scientific calculation
* pdist, squareform -> Convert a vector-form distance vector to a square-form distance matrix, and vice-versa
* json -> dump dict to json format to store pair value in postgres json field matplotlib -> data graphical 
* representation 
* psycopg2 -> postgres database connection 

# question 1

* Used line fitting algorithm y=mx+b. find out layer point and fit the line

# question 2 and 3

* Tried to solve through dbscan distance algorithm. due to every high noise point so used technology pdist, 
  squareform and numpy
  
* Distance calculation equation referenced stack overflow

* insert pair value in db using json format  for reducing row number. using child and parent keys
